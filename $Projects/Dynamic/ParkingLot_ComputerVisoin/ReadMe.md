For Hack West TX
The goal of this program is to have an input of a jpg inlcuding the normal parkinglot and output an image of all of the avaiable and taken spots highlighted accordingly. 

1. Using TypeScript and React Native to create the user interface for exchanging jpg's
2. Using python and libraries such as OpenCV, MatPlopLib, and NumPy to create contour lines and map out the current locations of the car
3. From there we graph the open spots and marl them green as it is an open spot
4. Once all spots are highlited, the new image is sent back to the user using the interface created.

<h1> Post Hackathon Update </h1>
<p> We did not realize the workload this project would bring as this was our first hackathon that only lasted 24 hours. Not to mention 2 out of 4 of our team members ended up cancelling mid project as I believe the workload was too much for the group and some decided to quit on the spot. With this being said we underestimated how long this would take and only managed to reach the pixel manipulation / parking lot object detection for this project </p>
