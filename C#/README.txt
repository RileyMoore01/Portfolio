I am currently in the process of getting certain features approved by my boss to be posted here.
I am finding pages that do not reveal much and still show a good amount of critical thinking and programming skills.


During my internship with PCCA I mostly developed in C#.
I was converting ASP.Core to ASP.Net using C#, Entity Framework, and Linq.
Working with a private company, I am not aloud to show the work I have completed.

The general gist is I used C# and the frameworks listed above to form an MVC architecture.
The back-end was mostly C# with some occasional Perl scripts and connecting Javascript functions.
Front-end was using as .cshtml file that allowed us to access the data retreived via the feature.
