During my internship I made this Csv reader feature to read in csv data given by the gins, to then insert or delete those records in our database.

The first way is using EasyCV for a more dynamic use of the application in our database.
<br />
The second, commented out, approach is a very technical way of reading CSV data. Considered a low-level approach.
