<h1> About </h1>
<p> I am glad to fortunate enough to single handedly develop an innovative patent for Integri Tees here in Lubbock. </p> <br />
<p> Here is some work that ended up being trashed in the process (can not post functional source code for obvious reasons). </p> <br />

<h1> Idea </h1>
<p> To begin, the company owner reached out to me for the need of an embeded system that would detect any mis-print on his manufactoring belt.</p> <br />
<p> The idea behind this project is to bring that to life. It has an ultrasonic sensor that will detect when a new iteration of the belt brings a shirt. </p> <br />
<p> Once the new shirt is detected, the raspberry pi will take a picture with the HQ Raspberry Pi Camera Module and compare to the reference image taken at the start of the press</p> <br />
<p> If there is a difference surpassing the threshold limit, then a buzzer will go off allowing the employees to know and stop the belt. </p> <br />
<p> From there, the employees will be shown a black-white image with only the differnces highlighted on the reference/difference image. </p> <br />
