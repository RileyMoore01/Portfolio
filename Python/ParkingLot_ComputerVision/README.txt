For Hack West TX
The goal of this program is to have an input of a jpg inlcuding the normal parkinglot and output an image of all of the avaiable and taken spots highlighted accordingly. 

1. Using TypeScript and React Native to create the user interface for exchanging jpg's
2. Using python and libraries such as OpenCV, MatPlopLib, and NumPy to create contour lines and map out the current locations of the car
3. From there we graph the open spots and marl them green as it is an open spot
4. Once all spots are highlited, the new image is sent back to the user using the interface created.
